Architecture
============

## Modules

 snpcc.py       -> The 'main' class

 snap/tui.py    -> Runs the event loop, captures input and delegates to state
                   management and screen-drawing modules.

 snap/screen.py -> Objects that represent the different screens of the app.
                   Given a reference to state and the cureses-screen, they
                   will draw themselves.

 snap/state.py  -> An object representing the client and server state.  Has
                   command functions which dispatch to the API wrapper for 
                   execution and updates the state.

 snap/client.py -> Object representing a snapchat client on the network.  Wraps
                   the api client with functions for manipulating volume. 

 snap/api.py    -> Handles the Low level communication with the snapcast
                   clients. This module does little more than wrap the async
                   calls.
